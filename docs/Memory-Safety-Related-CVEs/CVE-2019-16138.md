## Source

```rust
let mut ret = Vec::with_capacity(pixel_count);
unsafe {
    // RGBE8Pixel doesn't implement Drop, so it's Ok to drop half-initialized ret
    ret.set_len(pixel_count);
} // ret contains uninitialized data, so now it's my responsibility to return fully initialized ret
```

## Description / Analysis

Similar to [CVE-2018-20992](./CVE-2018-20992.md).

Use of uninitialized data (from `buffer.len()` to `new_len`.

`set_len` 's safety requirements are:

- new_len must be less than or equal to capacity().
- The elements at old_len..new_len must be initialized.
